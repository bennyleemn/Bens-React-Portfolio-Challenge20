          <div>My name is Ben Currier. I am a father of 2 boys that enjoys many things in life such as fishing, music, movies, computers and traveling.
          </div>

          <div>I recently decided to go thru a career pivot. Well, not really a pivot, more like an opportunity presented itself for me to move into a leadership position at the company I work for, so I took it and am running with it.
          </div>

          <div>My goal is to one day be a Solution Architect. In order to get there, I need to learn the basics of coding and development.
          </div>

          <div>The University of Minnesota had a program that will enable me to move from my current role as a Technical/Business Systems Analyst to an engineer role.

          Thats a little bit about me.
